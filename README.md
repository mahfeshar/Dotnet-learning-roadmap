# DotNet Learning Roadmap

Welcome!
This repository contains my personal notes, a learning roadmap, and resources for navigating the .NET ecosystem. The goal is to keep everything organized by splitting topics into separate folders, making it easier to reference and revisit content as I progress.

## Main Sections

1. **[Database](./Database/)**  
   Notes on working with databases in MS SQL, NoSQL.

2. **[CSharp](./CSharp/)**  
   Everything related to the C# language itself, for beginner level.

*(More sections will be added as I expand the roadmap.)*
